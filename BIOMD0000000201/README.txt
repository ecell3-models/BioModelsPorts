Notes
This is a model of the coupled Natch, Wnt and FGF modules as described in: 
A. Goldbeter and O. Pourquié , Modeling the segmentation clock as a network of coupled oscillations in the Notch, Wnt and FGF signaling pathways. J Theor Biol. 2008 Jun 7;252(3):574-85, pubmed ID: 18308339 
To uncouple the modules remove the reaction MAx_trans_Xa and set vsFK=vsF . 
The SBML version of the model was converted from the CellML version by Catherine Lloyd for the CellML repository .
