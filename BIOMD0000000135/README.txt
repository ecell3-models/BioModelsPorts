Notes
This a model from the article: 
Which model to use for cortical spiking neurons? 
Izhikevich EM. IEEE Trans Neural Netw. 2004 Sep;15(5):1063-70. 15484883 , 
Abstract: 
We discuss the biological plausibility and computational efficiency of some of the most useful models of spiking and bursting neurons. We compare their applicability to large-scale simulations of cortical neural networks.
The model is according to the paper Which Model to Use for Cortical Spiking Neurons? Figure1(J) subthreshold oscillations has been reproduced by MathSBML. The ODE and the parameters values are taken from the a paper Simple Model of Spiking Neurons The original format of the models are encoded in the MATLAB format existed in the ModelDB with Accession number 39948
Figure1 are the simulation results of the same model with different choices of parameters and different stimulus function or events.a=0.05; b=0.26; c=-60; d=0; V=-62; u=b*V;
